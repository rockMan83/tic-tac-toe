## My first python game

This was my first *real* python project.  Look Ma! No libraries to import!  It actually took me a few months to get all the loops and logic working and was pretty much done, except while cleaning up the code for upload to my repo, I accidentally deleted the main function loops and of course I didn't back up the code; **PERFECT** example of why I should have just uploaded to GitHub first and then cleaned it up.  Well, at least it'll help me resharpen my skills and maybe I'll even come up with a more efficient loop.
